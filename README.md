# TriviaChat-Lab

In this lab, you'll make a simple chat interface that plays a trivia game with the user!

## Checkpoint 1

TriviaChat Lab is installed/working, and when you send any message the chatbot responds with “I am da response!”

- Click the "Use as Template" button to make your own copy of the repo
- Clone your repo, do `yarn` to install packages, and start expo with `yarn expo start`
- **Find the correct line of code to uncomment to complete the checkpoint**

## Checkpoint 2

Your first piece of simple chat logic works, so that when the user says “Yes” the chatbot asks a question, and if the user says anything else the chatbot politely tells the user to say “Yes” to start.  
*FYI, for this checkpoint and onwards you're writing code! You'll mostly be adding to the `respondToUser()` function*

## Checkpoint 3

Come up with your own trivia question, and get it working with the chatbot! When done, your chatbot should ask the first question, tells the user if they got it right, then ask them a second question.

## Checkpoint 4

Your chatbot trivia game is working with three questions!

## Checkpoint 5 (optional)

Add more questions to your chatbot with more interesting logic. Examples:

- Multi-character dialogue. For example, the first “riddle” is asked by a troll on a bridge, then you advance to the cave entrance where a witch asks you the second riddle (can you figure out how to respond as different users with GiftedChat?)
- Randomly generated math problems (maybe the chatbot keeps score too)
- Hangman (this is tricky! Printing the word with the correct letters showing/hidden is a challenging “leetcode-esque” string problem)
- Use an API to get data for trivia (e.g. for a marvel movie quote API, “Which marvel character says this quote?”)
